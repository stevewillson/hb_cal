hb_cal (Horseblanket Calendar) will read events from a database and display them in a 'horseblanket' view (days across the top, a new row for each category of events).

iCal import and export support will be added.

Host a mongodb locally with the database name "hb_cal" to read and store data.

Add events (currently only for August 2019, in the form "2019-08-12" for the date format.
